### **Project Overview**

The Federal Government has recently released its plan to re-establish a "COVID-normal" in Australia, precipitated primarily on Australians receiving a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. In order to assist with what is likely the single largest logistical challenge ever faced by this government, they require your help to build a vaccination booking and management system.

The application will be a centralised vaccine management platform that can help public health officials manage vaccine distribution at scale and expedite vaccine administration for a large population. The solution should provide real-time access to vaccine-administration data to support decision-making and distribution efforts.
